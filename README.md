# 🧪 Benchmarks

A lightweight stress simulation script for mimicking camera + AI workload in production-like environments.

---

## ⚙️ What it does

Simulates realistic CPU load as if a live camera stream and AI processing were active — ideal for performance profiling, thermal testing or hardware tuning on edge devices like Raspberry Pi or Jetson Nano.

---

## 🚀 Run it

```bash
python main.py
```

## 📁 Structure

main.py — core simulation logic (camera loop, artificial delay, optional CPU threading)

🧠 Optional: customize processing intensity / FPS in code
